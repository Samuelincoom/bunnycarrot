this is a test plugin. but works. it works to automatically pull all media files and 
static files from a website to bunny cdn..
This was made by samuel ewudzi incoom and not yet official in our bunnycdn team yet. Its to solve the problem we have currently where our bunnycdn official channel cannot auto-pull from static files.
Just a private internal plugin. but you can use it to achieve what has been described. very soon we will bring auto-pull features of this personal test plugin to the official bunny cdn plugin too
Team is on it.

thank you
