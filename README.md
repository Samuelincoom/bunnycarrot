this is a test plugin. but works. it works to automatically pull all media files and 
static files from a website to bunny cdn..
This was made by samuel ewudzi incoom and not yet official in our bunnycdn team yet. 
just a private internal plugin. but you can use it to acheive what has been described. verry soon we will bring auto-pull features in this plugin to the official bunny cdn plugin channel
Team is on it.

thank you
